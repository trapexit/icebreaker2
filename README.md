# Icebreaker 2

This repo contains the source code to the 2007 strategy/action 3DO
game Icebreaker 2[0] developed by Andrew Looney[1] for Magnet
Interactive Studios. The game had been developed after the original
Icebreaker in 1995 but wasn't released until 2007 by Older Games.

In early 2023, after being asked by members of the community,
Mr. Looney released the source code to Icebreaker 2 under the GPLv3
license.

This repo was created on behalf of Mr. Looney by trapexit. The initial
code commit is completely unaltered from what was provided to the
community. The zip file originally containing the code was named
`IceTwo_6.6_source_code.zip`.
